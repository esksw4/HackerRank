Bianry Tree: 
- each node can have AT MOST two children
- ANY Tree is Binary tree if each node does not contain more than two children.
- Leaf Node: all left and right children are NULL

Complete Binary Tree:
- All levels except possibly the last are completly filled and all nodes are as left as possible
- max number of nodes at level i = 2^i
- height : 

Perfect Binary Tree:
- All levels are completely filled
- max number of nodes with height h = 2^(number of levels) - 1
- height with n number of nodes: h = log_2 (n+1) - 1

Balanced Binary Tree:
- Difference between height of left and right subtree for every node is not more than 1.

Binary Tree can be implemented using:
a) dynamically created nodes : Pointers
b) Arrays (mostly for complete binary tree)

Binary Search Tree:
